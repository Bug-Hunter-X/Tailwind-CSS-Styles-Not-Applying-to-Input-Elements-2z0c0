# Tailwind CSS Input Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not applying to input elements. The issue is likely related to a misconfiguration in how Tailwind is integrated with your project's CSS and JavaScript.

## Problem

After setting up Tailwind CSS according to the official documentation, styles are not applied to input elements (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, etc.).  The input fields appear with default browser styling.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring your Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) are correctly placed in your main CSS file and that the CSS file is properly imported into your JavaScript (or other) application entry point.
